ATF basics
==========

ATF is a set of Lua classes and extensions providing a simple way to
create, manage and use network connections, process Applink protocol
messages and use HMI protocol - everything needed for communication with
SDL. It's generally a library for black-box test development for SDL.

Test consists of several use cases - a set of data to be sent to input
SDL channels and data expected to be received from SDL output.

# Test script structure

Because ATF test runner is merely a Lua interpreter, test script is just
a Lua program. The script should create a Test table, using one of base
scripts, add some test cases and return this table to allow another test
script to extend this test with new cases. Test cases should be
implemented as functions with only argument - Test table. Test case
function name must start with a capital letter. Basically a test case
fills expectations table (seeÂ [expectations table]) and sends a fixed
message to SDL. When SDL responds, expectations are verified, and if all
expectations have been satisfied, the test case is considered passed.

The base test creates two connection to SDL - mobile connection and HMI
connection, and initializes them. Then an application is registered
using **RegisterAppInterface** call.

## Test cases

Test cases are functions, belonging to the Test table. Their name __must__
begin with a capital letter. To describe the purpose of the test case,
use **desciption(str)** function. It takes one string argument - description.
To make a test case critical - that is, if this case
fails, the Test will not continue execution, call
**critical(true)**.

## Expectations creating


To specify what data is expected to be received from SDL, the
Expectations __Table[expectations table]__ is used. Every item of this table
describes single message. To simplify Expectations writing ATF provides
several functions making typical expectations.

### EXPECT\_RESPONSE(correlationId, arguments, ...)

Returns expectation of mobile connection input. This function takes
following arguments: the first, **correlationId**, is the
correlation identifier of response expected. The latter ones,
**arguments**, are optional tables of expected response
arguments. If expectation has complied more than once, arguments are
checked against last arguments parameter.

### EXPECT\_NOTIFICATION(funcName, arguments, ...)


Returns expectation of mobile connection notification. The function
takes two arguments: **funcName**, name of notification, and
optional **arguments**, which are used to verify notification
data.

### EXPECT\_ANY


Returns expectation of any unexpected activity on mobile session.

### EXPECT\_ANY\_SESSION\_NOTIFICATION(funcName, arguments, ...)


Returns expectation of notification to any session.

### EXPECT\_EVENT(event, name)


Returns expectation of custom event

### EXPECT\_HMIRESPONSE


Returns expectation of HMI connection data. The only
argument, **id**, is identifier of request sent.

### EXPECT\_HMINOTIFICATION


Returns expectation of an HMI notification from SDL.

## Expectations extensions


Expectations may be extended with some extra specifications. They are
intended to be used in call chain: programmer can improve expectation
parameters by calling following methods one after one.

Example:

    EXPECT_NOTIFICATION("OnHMIStatus")
      :Timeout(5000)
      :Times(AnyNumber())
      :Do(function() print("OnHMIStatus got") end)

## Times


If you want an expectation to occur several times, add
**Times** call to expectation.

Example:

    EXPECT_NOTIFICATION("OnHMIStatus")
      :Times(2)

**Times()** arguments may be one of following values:

-   **x** or **Exactly(x)**, to specify that expectation should occur
    exactly _x_ times to get passed. Particularly, **Times(0)**
    means that expectation will fail test if occur

-   **AtMost(x)** - expectation should occur _x_ or fewer times

-   **AtLeast(x)** - expectation should occur _x_ or more times

-   **Between(x, y)** - expectation should occur between _x_ and _y_
    times

-   **AnyNumber()** - expectation may occur or not

## Do, DoOnce


These two functions takes one argument - function that will be called
when expectation complied. This callback function will be called with
two arguments: complied expectation and incoming data. **Do**
function registers callback forever, **DoOnce** - for the first
trigger only.

## Timeout

Default expectation timeout is 10 000 ms. To change it, call
**Timeout** function with new timeout value in milliseconds.

## Pin, Unpin

Pinned expectation is not to be removed when test case is finished. This
ability is used generally for some service expectations (timeout
controllers, notification handlers etc.) To make the expectation pinned,
call **Pin()** extension. To unpin it, call
**Unpin()**.

## ValidIf


In some cases the standard RPC validation routine is not
enough to verify expectation data. Use **ValidIf** function to
register verifying callback that would be used when expectation
complied. Callback should take two arguments: **expectation object** and
**data table**. If data is valid, function must return **true**,
otherwise it must return two values: **false** and error
message to be displayed in test report.

# Requests sending


The connectivity test provides two connections to SDL
channels: **mobileSession** and **hmiConnection**.

## Mobile side

To send a request from mobile application side, call
**mobileSession:SendRPC(message, filename)**. This function
returns **correlationId** field of request has been sent.
**filename** is optional. If is not **nil**, the file
contents added to **rpc** request binary data. For example,

    self.mobileSession:SendRPC("Alert", { alertText1 = "Hello" })
    self.mobileSession:SendRPC("PutFile",
                               {
                                 syncFileName = "icon.png",
                                 fileType = "GRAPHIC_PNG"
                               },
                               "icon.png")

To send an arbitrary message, use **Send** method. It takes the
Applink message, the following fields are supported:

-   **version (optional, default 2)**. Version of message

-   **encryption (optional, default false)**. Encryption flag

-   **frameType (optional, default 1)**. Frame Type field

-   **serviceType (required)**. Sevice Type field

-   **frameInfo (required)**. Frame Info field

-   **rpcType (required)**. If serviceType is 7, type of RPC
    request

-   **rpcFunctionId (required)**. RPC function id

-   **rpcCorrelationId (required)**. RPC correlation id

-   **payload (required)**. JSON payload of RPC
    request

-   **binaryData (optional)**. Binary data of message or RPC
    request

## **HMI** side

**HMIConnection** provides functions similar to
**MobileSession**'s.

-   **SendRequest(method, params)** Sends HMI
    request, returns id of sent message.

-   **SendNotification(method, params)** Sends notification
    with parameters.

-   **SendResponse(id, method, result, params)** Sends response
    to request with specified **id**, method name. **Result** field
    is a name of result code. For example, **"SUCCESS"** or
    **"ABORTED"**.

-   **Send(text)** Sends arbitrary text through
    HMI connection.

To send a message from **hmi** side, use
**hmiConnection:Send(message)**. We will add some more
convenient methods later. For example,

    self.hmiConnection:Send({
                              jsonrpc = "2.0",
                              method = "UI.OnSystemContext",
                              params =
                              {
                                appID = 100,
                                systemContext = "ALERT"
                              }
                            })

## Services


To start a service use **MobileSession:StartService(n)**
function. It takes service number and returns expectation awating for
**StartServiceACK** message. To end service, call
**MobileSession:StopService(n)**.

Example:

    self.mobileSession:StartService(11)
      :Do(function() print("Service started") end)

## Media streaming


ATF allows to start media streaming in background. Use
**MobileSession:StartStreaming(service, filename, bandwidth)**
to start media streaming. Optional **bandwidth** argument sets
maximum bandwidth of streaming (bytes per second). Default is 30 kbps.
Note that the service should be started before
**StartStreaming** is called.

Example:

    self.mobileSession:StartService(10)
      :Do(function() self.mobileSession:StartStreaming(10, "video.mpg", 30 * 1024) end)

To stop file streaming, call **StopStreaming(filename)**.

## Auxiliary functions


### RAISE\_EVENT(event, data)


Raises custom event with optional data. If there is an expectation it
will be satisfied.

### RUN\_AFTER


Use **RUN\_AFTER** routine to postpone function execution.
Usage: **RUN\_AFTER(function, timeout)**. The function will be
called in **timeout** msec.
